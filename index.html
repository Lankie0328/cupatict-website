        <h2>Mark Josh</h2>
        <p>I am Mark Josh S. Cupat, an 18-year-old college student of west bay college and currently taking BSMT course.
           I was raised and born in Brgy. Nueva Esperanza, Hinunangan Southern Leyte but currently living here at San Pedro Laguna due to my studies.
           When talking about my abilities and skills, well I can draw but not as much as an artist. I can also sing and dance but not that good enough to be called a singer and a dancer. 
           I am also good at playing basketball, chess and also swimming. I do workouts to have a healthy lifestyle. Aside from my abilities and skills I also have my favorites, I like OPM songs. I love cats. I am not a fan of sweets but i prefer chocolate drink than coffee. I also love watching anime and in addition I love sleeping after a tiring days. In terms of my personalities, I am patient and understanding. I am an introvert one, I like it more to be at home than to go out. I also have a sense of humor. And I am a good comforter. I am an honest person and I am someone you can trust on. I am also courageous enough to take responsibilities and diligent to my studies and someday to my work. I can also do things even though I am not that good enough to do it just so I can prove it to you that I am willingly able to do things that can make my life successful. I know that I sometimes down myself due to my thinking that I canâ€™t do it but then i know that I am a positive thinker and will always choose the good side. 
           I am now on my first year of college and to be honest it was a very challenging year since I enter college. Loaded of works and activities and also it needs more patience and it takes more responsibilities but I am brave and responsible enough to face those path of problems and challenges in life. PADAYON WAMBE!!!
